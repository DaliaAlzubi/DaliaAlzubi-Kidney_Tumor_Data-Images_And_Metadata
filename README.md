A novel CT dataset for kidney tumor cases. &lt;&lt;(8400)>>Scans!!
The dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zp6b2o99_SdTEgxQwArl-ZWrMUfzLJj0/view?usp=sharing 
The collected dataset consists of 8400 images of 120 adult patients who have performed a CT scan for suspected kidney masses. The images are provided in (DICOM) format, considered the most standard for interchange and transmitting medical images used worldwide. The data collected included a CT scan with contrast material and without contrast.

This dataset exceeds the other datasets regarding size, number of patients, and diversity of images. It is considered the first collected data from Jordan's King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH). The CT scan images and metadata were collected manually, supervised by a specialist team. There are 70 CT scans for each patient. It is strongly believed that this dataset can be the basis for subsequent studies to diagnose tumors and stones, cysts, and any kidney problems, such as inflation, infection, and hydronephrosis.
